# [Binkd Token Sale](https://binkd.com)
This document describes the Binkd token sale specification and implementation and gives an overview of the rules set for the Presale/Crowdsale. The Binkd Solidity smart contracts are based on the [Open Zeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity) audited contracts.

## Overview

Binkdâ€™s mission is to be the world's easiest and most trusted way to buy and sell cryptocurrency.  We are filling a major void in the current cryptocurrency broker / exchange landscape by offering a user-friendly front-end broker app and site along with a decentralized exchange and P2P transactions.  Binkd is an easy-to-use hybrid cryptocurrency exchange with an off-chain broker app and site that lets customers fund their account with fiat currency and exchange it for any cryptocurrency quickly and affordably and an on-chain decentralized exchange built on the Ethereum blockchain. 

## Specification
The token sale is open only to whitelisted ( kyc compliant ) users. Every user has the same individual cap for the amount of Ether he can contribute. In the sale, a capped number of tokens is offered and there will always be a finite supply of tokens ( ie minted with a hard cap ).
